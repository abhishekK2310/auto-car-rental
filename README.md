ðŸš— Car Rental System in Java
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a Car Rental System built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java.
It simulates a real-world car rental service where customers can rent cars, and the system keeps track of rentals.

The project demonstrates OOP concepts like:

Encapsulation

Abstraction

Constructors

Getters & Setters

Object Associations (Customer â†” Car â†” Rental)

ðŸ›  Features

Add new cars to the rental system

Rent a car if available

Track rented cars with rental details (customer, car, duration)

Prevent renting if the car is already booked

Print rental records

â”œâ”€â”€ Rental.java       # Represents a Rental record (Car + Customer + Days)
â”œâ”€â”€ CarRentalSystem.java  # Main system to manage rentals

Car: Honda City, Available: true
Car: Hyundai Creta, Available: true

Customer John rents Honda City for 5 days.

Car: Honda City, Available: false
Car: Hyundai Creta, Available: true
